Exercise files from <a href="https://www.nand2tetris.org/">The Elements of Computing Systems</a>.

A book for anyone looking to build a computer from scratch (emulated); logic gates to software.

Highly recommended for computer science or software engineering students, particularly in year 1/2.

I've added comments to help anyone who comes across this repo working on the exercices themselves.
